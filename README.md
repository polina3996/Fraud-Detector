The Fraud Detector project demonstrates the implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) using a practical example.

SRP is one of the most important principles in software development. 
SRP is included in the SOLID group of principles and is the first in it. This emphasizes its exceptional importance.

The goal of the project: to analyze the implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in Java code using a practical example. 
Understanding the SRP principle opens the way to creating clean code. Applications written using this principle are easier to operate and support.

To examine the SRP principle, a mini project with a business idea related to the automatic detection of fraudulent transactions is used. 
The project was deliberately chosen to be simple in order to focus primarily on the practical study of the SRP principle.

As a result, we got a solution in which:
- each business rule is implemented separately from each other;
- the implementation of each business rule is easy to find, since it is located in a separate class;
- automatic tests are written separately for each business rule;
